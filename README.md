# A very brief introduction to `git` and GitHub

__Andrew Nolan__ (He/Him)


### Demo material:  
- The slides for the talk can be found in the [`intro2git&github.ipynb`](https://github.com/EASC-305/intro2git/blob/main/intro2git%26github.ipynb) notebook.  A rendered version of the slides can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/EASC-305/intro2git/blob/main/intro2git%26github.ipynb).

- The commands used in the live `git` demo are recorded in [`gitdemo.md`]().

### Software requirements for the live demo:
- Access to the command line. Shouldn't be a problem on OSX or Linux. For Windows see `git` installation instructions about [`Git Bash`](https://gitforwindows.org/).

- `git` A link installation instructions for your respective operating system can be found [here](https://gitbookdown.dallasdatascience.com/setting-up-git.html).

- `python` I'd recommend you an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution of python.

- `atom` A great, and easy to use, text editor with built in compatibility with  `git` and GitHub. Can be downloaded from here: [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/) .
